##### Some notes about hashing:
[Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function): a method of converting a name (string, number,...) to a code of sorts

There are a finite number of hashes possible for a particular algorithm. The strength of an algorithm is determined by:
- how easy/difficult it is to unhash/revert the string
- how many possible hashes there are (risk of collisions)
  - collision are when two string/files share the same hash
