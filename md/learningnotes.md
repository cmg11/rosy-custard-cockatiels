## Computer Science
##### Some notes about hashing:
[**Hashing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function): a method of converting a key (string, number, piece of data,...) to a code of sorts.

![Example hash function](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Hash_table_4_1_1_0_0_1_0_LL.svg/240px-Hash_table_4_1_1_0_0_1_0_LL.svg.png)  
In the above function, there is a collision (red hash, "02") for "John Smith" and "Sandra Dee." There are only 15 possible hashes for this algorithm.

There are a finite number of hashes possible for a particular algorithm. The strength of an algorithm can be determined by:
- how easy/difficult it is to unhash/revert the string
- how many possible hashes there are (risk of collisions)
  - collision: when two string/files share the same hash

Example algorithm: the [md5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5)  
Since the MD5 always returns a hash with a fixed byte amount, it is one way; the full information of the hashed object is not retained.  
- [r/eli5](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/21szbj/eli5_how_can_a_hash_of_a_file_ie_an_md5_checksum/) -- an explanation from reddit
- another good explaination [here](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/understanding-hash-functions-and-keeping-passwords-safe--net-17577) (the explanation is from a PHP pov)  

In order to create hashes that are harder to crack, you can add [salt][1]

## Python Topics/Functions
[**`zip()`**][3]: takes two iterables (iterables meaning something that can be iterated over, like a list), goes through both taking and combining the *i*-th element of each and forms a tuple of *i*-th iterable. Repeats until end of shortest iterable is reached.  
*example* (from [here][2]):
```python
>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> y = [4, 5, 6]
>>> zipped = zip(x, y)
>>> list(zipped)
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
```  
The *i*-th element of each list `x , y` is present since both lists are the same length.

Note: kind of like dot product but not really--similar in the combining the *i*-th element, but not much else.

[`repr()`][4]: There are [multiple methods of printing][5] to the console; while `print()` and `write()` give more human readable outputs, `repr()` gives output that can be read by an interpreter--it looks more like the output you would get after running a function in the command line  
*Note*: if you want multiple interpreter-like outputs, you'll have to print each one (so far as I know)
Example use of `repr()` [here][5]

## Data Science
### [Simplest Explanation of SVM's. Ever.][7]
From r/MachineLearning (alternatively, there's [*this*][8]...)
We have 2 colors of balls on the table that we want to separate.

![Balls on a table](http://i.imgur.com/zDBbD.png)

We get a stick and put it on the table, this works pretty well right?

![Now a stick!](http://i.imgur.com/aLZlG.png)

Some villain comes and places more balls on the table, it kind of works but one of the balls is on the wrong side and there is probably a better place to put the stick now.

![baddie, oh no!](http://i.imgur.com/kxWgh.png)

SVMs try to put the stick in the best possible place by having as big a gap on either side of the stick as possible.

![gap trick](http://i.imgur.com/ePy4V.png)

Now when the villain returns the stick is still in a pretty good spot.

![villian returns](http://i.imgur.com/BWYYZ.png)

There is another trick in the SVM toolbox that is even more important. Say the villain has seen how good you are with a stick so he gives you a new challenge.

![a new challenge :O](http://i.imgur.com/R9967.png)

Thereâ€™s no stick in the world that will let you split those balls well, so what do you do? You flip the table of course! Throwing the balls into the air. Then, with your pro ninja skills, you grab a sheet of paper and slip it between the balls.

![table flipping time](http://i.imgur.com/WuxyO.png)

Now, looking at the balls from where the villain is standing, they balls will look split by some curvy line.

![and a curvy line...](http://i.imgur.com/gWdPX.png)

Boring adults the call balls data, the stick a classifier, the biggest gap trick optimization, call flipping the table kernelling and the piece of paper a hyperplane.

### Quick notes

#### [Multiclass Classifiers][13]
Simply put: when classifying into on of more than 2 classes. Classification into one of 2 classes would be *binary* classification.

#### [Instance Based Learning][15]
Instance based learning relies on comparing new problems with instances seen in training, rather than focusing explicitly on generalisation.

#### Notes on the titanic excercise/decision trees:  
Decision trees don't replicate the portions of categories that each entry falls into (like a certain amount o men vs. women surviving), they simply *make decisions* based on those factors as a sort of split point.
- *Example*: The titanic decision tree says 67% to 23% female to male split--that doesn't mean that of the predicted females/males of a test data set would get that same survival ratio, it's just reflecting what the training indicates. It's a *tool for visualisation*, **not** the prediction itself. You just keep going along the splits based on where you fall, and the percentages show previously indicated likelihoods.

### Some things not to forget
- [latent variable][9]: variables that are inferred through direct observations(example: quality of life being inferred from health, employment, social belonging...)
- [the difference of pearson correlation vs regression analysis][10]
- [Why 'X' is uppercase and 'y' is lowercase][11]
  - Linear algebra. Uppcase denotes mtx, lowercase denotes vector.
- [Why there aren't spaces when assigning fxn parameters but there are during variable assignment][12]
  - Basically doing:
    - *this* `a_function(thisVal=5, n=6)`
    - **not** this `a_function(thisVal = 5, n = 6)`
- Bias and variance have a relationship not dissimilar to accuracy and precision (read [here][darts])

### Vocab
**panacea**: a cureall  
**disjunction**: lack of consistency
